ERROR in ./node_modules/csvjson/src/stream.js 17:14-31
  Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'C:\Users\jogle\arcgis-experience-builder-1.15\ArcGISExperienceBuilder\client\node_modules\csvjson\src'
  Did you mean './stream'?
  Requests that should resolve in the current directory need to start with './'.
  Requests that start with a name are treated as module requests and resolve within module directories (node_modules).
  If changing the source code is not an option there is also a resolve options called 'preferRelative' which tries to resolve these kind of requests in the current directory too.
